# Minecraft-2D

This project has been made for a weekend assignment in the AppleSeeds Fullstack Developer Bootcamp by Ron Klik.
The game is available on: https://strong-basbousa-39e2df.netlify.app/

This game is built with vanilla javascript only, using HTML, CSS, JS and DOM manipulation.
The game loads a random map, out of 6 available maps.
The user can choose a tool and mine a tile corresponding to the tool he chose.
The Thanos button is a special button, when selected it will start removing 50% of the available tiles randomly.

The user can also save his progress with the 'save' button and load it with 'load', this is done with localStorage.
'reset' will reset the current map to its initial state.

Known bugs:
* Some tiles randomly get their classes removed, not sure why, the tiles appear to be random each time.
* After pressing Thanos, the tiles that disappeared don't show white border when hovered.
